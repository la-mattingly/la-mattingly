    <p>
        Welcome to my MCAT Tutoring webpage! My name is Landon. I’m an Arizona State
        University graduate, first-attempt 523 MCAT scorer, and incoming M.D.
        candidate at The Ohio State University College of Medicine.
    </p>

    <p>
        I feel passionate about tutoring for the MCAT because it was a test that did
        not come as easily to me as most other 520+ scorers. My Kaplan full-length
        diagnostic exam was a 499. It took me several hundred hours to discover
        optimal study techniques, and I experienced many dreaded plateaus en route
        to my score.
    </p>

    <p>
        My tutoring philosophy revolves around two main beliefs:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>1. Deep, conceptual understanding is more important than memorization.</strong>
        Research has long shown depth of processing correlates with retention (Craik et al.). 
        Given the breadth of material evaluated by the MCAT, it is very likely you will only be able to review a piece of material only once during your whole study period. 
        Consequently, ensuring a profound level of comprehension is obtained for all material (especially high yield) is necessary to score well. 

    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2. The MCAT is primarily designed to measure perseverance, adaptability, and confidence; intelligence is secondary.</strong>
        Naturally, MCAT score correlates with intelligence. 
        Some people will always have an easier time achieving a certain score than others. 
        However, I personally believe exams such as the SAT and LSAT – with minimal content and simple structure – are much more dependent on natural abilities than the MCAT. 
        A strong content foundation + confidence + test-taking skills = high probability of answering a given question correctly. 
        Developing the content foundation is obtained through perseverance of setbacks in your studying and adapting based on what’s working and what isn’t. 
    </p>

    <h2>Tutoring Session Types</h2>

    <p>
        I categorize my tutoring into three main session types:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Study Plan Consultation</strong><br>
        A one-time, one-hour session designed to help you build or refine a study
        plan based on your current stage of MCAT preparation. Ideal for students
        just starting out or those struggling with plateaus.<br>
        <em>$20 (one hour)</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Directed Content Tutoring</strong><br>
        Traditional tutoring focused on specific topics you find challenging.
        You identify the topic, I prepare in advance, and we work through your
        misunderstandings together.<br>
        <em>$35/hour</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Longitudinal Comprehensive Tutoring</strong><br>
        A structured, ongoing approach combining consultation and directed content
        tutoring. We meet regularly (typically weekly) to review progress, solidify
        difficult material, and plan the upcoming week. I believe this approach is
        the most effective for substantial score improvement.<br>
        <em>$35/hour</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        I do not provide directed content tutoring for the CARS section, though I
        am happy to offer advice upon request.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note the competitiveness of my rates. Large test-prep companies
        often charge $200–$250 per hour, frequently for tutors with scores around
        515. Private tutors with 520+ scores also charge similar rates.
