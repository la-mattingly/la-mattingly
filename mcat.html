    <p>
        Welcome to my MCAT Tutoring webpage! My name is Landon. I’m an Arizona State
        University graduate, first-attempt 523 MCAT scorer, and incoming M.D.
        candidate at The Ohio State University College of Medicine.
    </p>

    <p>
        I feel passionate about tutoring for the MCAT because it was a test that did
        not come as easily to me as most other 520+ scorers. My Kaplan full-length
        diagnostic exam was a 499. It took me several hundred hours to discover
        optimal study techniques, and I experienced many dreaded plateaus en route
        to my score.
    </p>

    <p>
        My tutoring philosophy revolves around two main beliefs:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>1. Deep, conceptual understanding is more important than memorization.</strong>
        Research in cognitive psychology has long shown that depth of processing
        correlates strongly with retention (Craik &amp; Lockhart). Given the breadth
        of material tested on the MCAT, it is very likely that you will only
        encounter many topics once during your entire study period. Ensuring a
        profound level of understanding—especially for high-yield material—is
        therefore essential.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2. The MCAT primarily measures perseverance, adaptability, and confidence.</strong>
        Intelligence matters, but it is secondary. Exams like the SAT or LSAT—with
        limited content and simpler structure—depend more heavily on natural test-taking
        ability. In contrast, the MCAT rewards sustained effort, strategic adaptation,
        and confidence built through experience. A strong content foundation + confidence + test-taking skills =
        a high probability of answering a given question correctly. Developing this
        foundation requires persevering through setbacks and adapting your study
        methods based on what is and isn’t working.
    </p>

    <h2>Tutoring Session Types</h2>

    <p>
        I categorize my tutoring into three main session types:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Study Plan Consultation</strong><br>
        A one-time, one-hour session designed to help you build or refine a study
        plan based on your current stage of MCAT preparation. Ideal for students
        just starting out or those struggling with plateaus.<br>
        <em>$20 (one hour)</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Directed Content Tutoring</strong><br>
        Traditional tutoring focused on specific topics you find challenging.
        You identify the topic, I prepare in advance, and we work through your
        misunderstandings together.<br>
        <em>$35/hour</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Longitudinal Comprehensive Tutoring</strong><br>
        A structured, ongoing approach combining consultation and directed content
        tutoring. We meet regularly (typically weekly) to review progress, solidify
        difficult material, and plan the upcoming week. I believe this approach is
        the most effective for substantial score improvement.<br>
        <em>$35/hour</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        I do not provide directed content tutoring for the CARS section, though I
        am happy to offer strategic advice upon request.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note the competitiveness of my rates. Large test-prep companies
        often charge $200–$250 per hour, frequently for tutors with scores around
        515. Private tutors with 520+ scores typically charge similar rates.
