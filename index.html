        Hello, my name is Landon Mattingly and this is my personal website. 
        Currently, I am a 2025-2026 Fulbright Scholar in Budapest, Hungary where I am studying mathematics and computational neuroscience. 
        Previously, I graduated from Arizona State University with majors in Mathematics and Neuroscience summa cum laude from Barrett, The Honors College. 
        Next year, I will begin my M.D. at The Ohio State College of Medicine. Test
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the last few years, I’ve enjoyed studying math as an end in itself. 
        However, I am becoming increasingly interested in applying these technical skills to medical research. 
        My career goal (as it stands) is to work in an academic setting while maintaining some degree of scholarly activity. 
        I’ve also always felt gratified by the time I spend working with the disadvantaged in medicine, and I hope to continue to do so in the future. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of work, I have hobbies in personal health (lifting, running, cooking) and reading. 
        My favorite genre of book is philosophical fiction. 
        I intend to build out the “Personal” page of this directory with material related to my interests.
